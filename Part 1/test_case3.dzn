% test 3

num = 4;
cap = 5;
refill = 3;
fun = [4,1,2,3];
K = 25; 


% Satisfiable 
% Max total = 42
% Run time = 70 msec
% comparing to test case 1, increase of refill amount can lead to an increase of maximum total fun can get.
% Which is trivial that the more a machine can refill, the more games a player can play.
